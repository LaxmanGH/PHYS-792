+ Transportation:This is the process in which a particle moves in a medium without loss of energy. 
+ Ionization:The process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electron is called ionization.
  + eIon:
  + ionIon:
+ Bremmstrahlung:Electromagnetic radiation emmitted by a charged particle when it accelerates or decelerate when passing through the field of a nucleus is called Bremsstrahlung.
+ Compton Scattering:The scattering of atomic electrons by the photon is called compton scattering.
+ Pair-Production:The creation of a subatomic particle and its antipartice from a neutral boson is refer as the pair-production.
+ Photo-electric effect: The emission of electrons when the photon of energy greater than threshold energy of a metal falls on the surface of it is called photoelectric effect.
